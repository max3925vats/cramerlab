# The Cramer Lab @ RPI
The website for the Cramer Lab at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
We do Molecular Bioprocessing Research.

This website was made using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and the theme/template is heavily adapted from the [RPI Website](http://rpi.edu/). 

Feel free to adapt it to your requirements, we do appreciate credit if you use some of our code.
