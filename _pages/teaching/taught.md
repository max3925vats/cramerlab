### Chromatographic Separation Processes (Spring Semester)

#### Course Outline
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an interdisciplinary course suitable for graduate students and qualified seniors in Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, Biology, and Biomedical Engineering. The objective of this course is to familiarize the student with the theory and practice of the state of the art of analytical and preparative chromatographic separation processes. Topics include: general concepts (e.g. dynamics of zone migration, multicomponent adsorption, chromatographic dispersion, linear and non-linear chromatography); liquid chromatographic techniques (e.g. reversed-phase, ion exchange, affinity, chiral, metal chelate, and size exclusion); modes of operation (e.g. gradient, preparative elution, displacement, and continuous chromatography); novel morphologies (e.g. annular, radial flow, perfusion, and membrane chromatography) and chromatographic applications in biotechnology (applications of various modes of operation sequencing of chromatographic operations, and multidimensional separations for proteomics). Critical reviews of the current literature will be carried out to expose the students to the latest developments in the field. Laboratory demonstrations as well as computer simulations will be employed throughout the course to illustrate important concepts. An individual project on a chromatographic topic of interest will be required for graduate students and will be optional (i.e. extra credit) for undergraduates.</p>

### Chemical Engineering Separations (Fall Semester)

#### Course Outline
<p style="text-align:justify;">Although separations have been an integral part of chemical engineering education for many years, the recent emergence of industries such as biotechnology and nanotechnology have significantly increased the demand for chemical engineers well schooled in the fundamentals of separation processes.  The objective of this senior course is to familiarize the chemical engineering students with the fundamental principles of Separation Processes. We will examine both equilibrium controlled separation processes as well as separation processes that involve both mass transport and equilibrium considerations. In order to probe the key concepts in depth, the course will focus primarily on distillation, absorption and membranes. However throughout the course, a wide variety of separation processes will be brought to the student's attention to broaden the discussion. In particular, examples from biotechnology will be used to illustrate key concepts. In addition to teaching the fundamental principles involved in these unit operations, the course will also introduce the students to specific subtleties associated with a wide variety of separation processes both old and new.  In class problems will be used throughout the course to deepen the students' understanding of the material. Computer instruction will be employed throughout the course to illustrate important characteristics of these separation systems. In addition, Aspen will be employed to solve complex distillation problems.</p>
